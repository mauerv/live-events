## Live Events

Complex online gatherings are impossible to have with current products. They all specialize in improving your management of a single "conversation thread". Skype, Hangouts, Zoom, etc. Everything is single-threaded.

## Multi-threaded Conversations

This is an attempt to provide a different experience. Users join a call, but they can jump around from a bunch of different conversations as they see fit.

## Running it

In order to run it, you need to also have the [backend](https://github.com/mauerv/live-events) running and a Janus media server running too.
